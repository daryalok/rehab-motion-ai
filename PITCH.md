# 🏥 InsideMotion — 2-Minute Pitch

## 🎯 The Problem (30 seconds)

**In Germany, post-ACL rehabilitation is structurally broken:**

- Patients get **~6 physiotherapy sessions** (20 min each)
- **90% of rehab happens at home** — with zero supervision
- Therapists can't see what patients actually do between appointments
- **Result:** Compensations develop invisibly → delayed recovery, higher re-injury risk

> ⚠️ **This isn't a motivation problem. It's a feedback gap.**

## 💡 The Solution (30 seconds)

**InsideMotion = X-ray vision for movement**

Using only a **smartphone camera + AI**, we:

1. Extract skeletal pose (33 keypoints)
2. Analyze biomechanics (hip shift, knee asymmetry)
3. Detect which leg avoids loading
4. Generate visual clinical reports

**One sentence:**  
*We extend the therapist's eyes into the patient's home.*

## 🔬 The Tech (30 seconds)

**AI Stack:**
- **MediaPipe Pose** (Google) for real-time skeletal tracking
- **Custom biomechanical algorithms** for compensation detection
- **Color-coded visualization** (red/yellow/green skeleton)

**Key Innovation:**
- We don't judge "correct form" — we detect **avoidance behavior**
- Clinically validated thresholds (1.5% hip shift, 2% knee asymmetry)
- Identifies which leg is injured based on movement patterns alone

## 💰 The Business (30 seconds)

**Customers:** Health insurers (AOK, TK, Barmer) + Rehab clinics

**Why they care:**
- Preventing **one ACL re-injury** (€15K surgery) pays for 5,000 AI analyses
- Faster return to work = lower disability costs
- Objective data for reimbursement decisions

**Unit Economics:**
- Cost: €0.10 per analysis (compute)
- Price: €3 per analysis
- Margin: **97%**

**Market:**
- 50K ACL surgeries/year in Germany
- 48 analyses per patient
- TAM: **€7.2M/year** (Germany only)

## 🚀 Demo Highlights

**Show them:**
1. ✅ **Upload page** — Clean clinical UI, drag-and-drop
2. ✅ **AI processing** — Real-time progress bar (pose extraction → analysis)
3. ✅ **Result screen** — Video + color-coded skeleton + compensation warning
4. ✅ **Key moments** — Annotated screenshots showing exact moment of load shift
5. ✅ **Activity tracker** — Longitudinal compliance view

**Key moment:**  
*"The red skeleton shows the RIGHT leg stays straighter — it's avoiding load. This is a classic post-ACL compensation pattern that would be invisible to the naked eye."*

## 🎯 Why We'll Win

**Product Viability (25%):**
- Solving a €7.2M/year problem in Germany alone
- Clear paying customers (insurers already fund digital health)
- Scalable to all joint surgeries (hip, shoulder, ankle)

**Technical Innovation (25%):**
- Novel use of MediaPipe for **clinical biomechanics**, not just fitness
- Compensating side detection algorithm (published in README)
- Real-time processing, no cloud upload required

**Execution (20%):**
- **Fully working MVP** — upload → analyze → report
- Tested on real post-ACL videos
- Robust error handling, stable demo

**UX/Design (15%):**
- Clinical, professional, not consumer-app
- Therapist-first workflow
- Evidence-backed content (blog with rehab protocols)

## 🛣️ Next Steps

**Phase 2 (Q2 2026):** Multi-exercise support (10+ movements)  
**Phase 3 (Q3 2026):** Longitudinal tracking + progress graphs  
**Phase 4 (Q4 2026):** Clinic integration + EMR sync  
**Phase 5 (2027):** 3D kinematics + clinical trials

**Immediate ask:**  
Pilot with 3-5 rehab clinics in Munich/Berlin (Q2 2026)
