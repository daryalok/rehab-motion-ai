# 🏥 InsideMotion — AI Rehab Inside the Body

## 🦵 Post-ACL Knee Rehabilitation with Real Feedback at Home

We help physiotherapists see invisible ACL compensations during home rehabilitation using AI and a simple camera.

## 🩺 Problem

In Germany, post-ACL rehabilitation is **structurally limited**.

- Patients typically receive **~6 physiotherapy sessions** of 20 minutes
- This is **not enough** to retrain correct movement patterns
- Most rehabilitation happens **at home, without supervision**
- Therapists only see **short snapshots** — compensations develop invisibly
- Patients are expected to self-rehab, but receive **no feedback**

> ⚠️ **This is not a motivation problem.**  
> **It's a feedback gap.**

### 🔴 Undetected load avoidance and asymmetry lead to:

- ⏱️ **Delayed recovery**
- 📉 **Stalled progress**
- 🚨 **Higher re-injury risk**
- 💰 **Increased long-term costs** for insurers

---

## 💡 Solution

InsideMotion extends the therapist's eyes into the patient's home.

Using only a **camera** and **AI-based motion analysis**, we:

- ✅ **Detect** load avoidance on the injured knee
- 👁️ **Visualize** compensation patterns invisible to the naked eye
- 📊 **Provide** clinically useful insights to physiotherapists
- 🏠 **Enable** safe, feedback-driven home rehabilitation

> 🎯 **We don't diagnose.**  
> 🎯 **We don't replace clinicians.**  
> 🎯 **We provide decision support.**

## 👥 Users & Customers

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 👨‍⚕️ **Primary User** | Physiotherapist |
| 📹 **Data Source** | Patient (at home) |
| 💼 **Customer** | German health insurers & rehabilitation clinics |

### 💡 Why insurers care:

- 💰 **Preventing one ACL re-injury** offsets the cost of thousands of AI sessions
- ⚡ **Faster return to work**
- 📉 **Lower long-term disability costs**

## 🧠 What the AI Does (MVP Scope)

### 📋 Use Case
- **Focus:** Post-ACL knee rehab
- **Exercise:** Bodyweight squat

### 🔍 From a simple video, the system:

1. 🦴 **Extracts** skeletal pose
2. 📐 **Analyzes** knee flexion symmetry
3. ⚖️ **Tracks** hip shift and center-of-mass drift
4. 🚨 **Detects** early load escape to the healthy leg

### 💬 Example insight:

> *"At 32° knee flexion, load shifts to the healthy leg — a typical post-ACL compensation."*

---

## 🧪 Why This Is Different

- 🎯 We **don't judge correctness** — we detect avoidance behavior
- 📊 We compare patients to **themselves over time**, not to population norms
- 📈 We focus on **longitudinal recovery patterns**
- 👨‍⚕️ **Human-in-the-loop** by design (therapist-first)

> 🔬 **X-ray vision for movement.**
